### Regression Model
##### Regression Challenge for Predicting the selling price of a residential property depends on a number of factors, including the property age, availability of local amenities, and location.

##### In this challenge, we will use a dataset of real estate sales transactions to predict the price-per-unit of a property based on its features. The price-per-unit in this data is based on a unit measurement of 3.3 square meters.

##### The data consists of the following variables:

###### i. Transaction_date - the transaction date (for example, 2013.250=2013 March, 2013.500=2013 June, etc.)

###### ii. House_age - the house age (in years)

###### iii. Transit_distance - the distance to the nearest light rail station (in meters)

###### iv. Local_convenience_stores - the number of convenience stores within walking distance

###### v. Latitude - the geographic coordinate, latitude

###### vi. Longitude - the geographic coordinate, longitude

###### vii. Price_per_unit house price of unit area (3.3 square meters)

##### The challenge is to explore and prepare the data, identify predictive features that will help predict the price_per_unit label, and train a regression model that achieves the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) you can achieve (which must be less than 7) when evaluated against a test subset of data.

##### Save your trained model, and then use it to predict the price-per-unit for a given real estate transaction
